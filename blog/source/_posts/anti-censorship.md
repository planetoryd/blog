# The purpose of opposing censorship

For me, the purpose is to give an opportunity for our project, or many of the users will not be able to use it. In western values, it is about their free speech, and in socialist values it is encouraged but not seriously implemented. The purpose here is about neither of them. Opposing censorship is merely to create the possibility of practising an ideal freedom of speech, the word 'possibility' among which is to say we shall at least have the ability to get free speech which is the prerequisite of all other things. We should create it first before thinking or criticizing free speech. Anyway, you can't criticize such dweb free speech before it actually appears. From another perspective, decentralized networks are just too hard to ban after they have been created, so it makes no actual sense to oppose it.

Dweb free speech contains the ability to neglect existing laws, such as intellectual property laws, and national security laws. The old means of communication have to be conquered before the revolution happens. Socialist countries often have stricter suppression of free speech, in which we have a larger undeveloped market where those foreign capitalists can't access, and people there will be more motivated to use The Network since domestic monoplies are often unsatisfying.

# How to

Mesh networks are often mentioned as an ultimate way to counter censorship, which is in fact impractical especially in socailist countries where the physical control of cities are relatively higer, but this should be the networking of the future. The general idea of avoiding censorship is to pretend to be normal traffic, making it indistinguishable from legal traffic which matters to economy. Most censorship-bypassing services in China are set up in this way. Others use private line, avoiding to pass through GFW. There's always a way to disguise as normal traffic, and no one knows who are using and what is transferred in some seemingly normal traffic.

Assuming China has blocked all **peer connections** and only verified servers can be dialed, which is an extreme situation that harms internet infrastructure and economy, what we can do is to run a blockchain that pays people who have the access to those servers to transform them into our relay servers and who are willing to punch holes on this system. However, China is not Russia, which cares about economy. It is unlikely that this assumption comes true. The circumstance for dweb will only be better, as internet develops.

China can block peer connections, but they can't block **international connections**. International connections are the other way out even if the domestic connections are blocked, which can be between any nodes in China and any nodes with public IP outside. It becomes 'any nodes outside' simply because the government won't and can't verify every foreign website which includes some websites of trade partners.

But why almost none of torrenting softwares survive in China ? The problem is not about protocol, but about human power. These torrenting softwares failed to fund themselves, which is the issue we aim to solve and has been addressed elsewhere. The technology of censorship is constantly evolving, while we can always find a way out with patches in time.

The task in western countries is much easier, but with emphasis on anonymity due to their ability and experience on striking copyright infringement. Then, the western users can help users in countries having censorship.

As the fundamental requirement of dweb, censorship-resistance and connectivity is the top concern. According to the team members of IPFS, one kind of dweb, they seek to get commercial adoptions and wide applications of Filecoin, which is the way of manually creating the burden of censoring for the government. The future reaction of government is unknown, but our dweb share the same protocol with IPFS, it will be benefited too.
